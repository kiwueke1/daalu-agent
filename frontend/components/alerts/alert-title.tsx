/**
 * Build a human-friendly headline from an alert.
 *
 * Prometheus annotations are generic ("Pod is crash looping.",
 * "Deployment has not matched the expected number of replicas.").
 * The operator wants to know *which* pod / deployment from a glance.
 *
 * Strategy: read the subject (pod / deployment name) from the alert's
 * `metadata_json.labels` and prepend a short, Title-Cased subject to
 * the original sentence. Examples:
 *
 *   "Pod is crash looping."
 *     → "Octavia pod is crash looping."  (pod=octavia-health-manager-…)
 *
 *   "Deployment has not matched the expected number of replicas."
 *     → "Argocd-Dex-Server deployment has not matched the expected …"
 *
 * Falls back to the original title when we can't derive a subject.
