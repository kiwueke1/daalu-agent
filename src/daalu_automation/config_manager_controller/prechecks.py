"""Tier-A ``host_cluster_ready`` precheck for the config-manager-controller.

Before the reconcile loop runs ``helm upgrade --install`` of the NV-CM
chart, confirm the target cluster has the cluster-scoped singletons the
chart's CRs depend on (installed once, out-of-band):

* **Envoy Gateway** — the shared ``GatewayClass`` (``envoy-gateway``) the
  chart references with ``createGatewayClass=false``.
* **cert-manager** — its ``Certificate`` + ``ClusterIssuer`` CRDs, so
  ``*.<slug>.host.example.com`` certs can issue.
* **CloudNativePG** — its ``Cluster`` CRD, the chart's Postgres backend.

Without these, ``helm install`` either fails with an opaque "no matches
for kind" error or silently leaves Gateways/Certificates stuck Pending.
Catching it here flips the row to ``error`` with a precise "missing X"
message instead.

The chart-creation logic itself runs as the controller's ServiceAccount
in host-cluster mode (or the tunnel kubeconfig in customer-cluster mode);
this precheck reads against the same target.
