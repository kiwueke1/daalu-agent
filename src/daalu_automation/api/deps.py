"""Shared FastAPI dependencies.

Tenancy model. Every authenticated request resolves a ``tenant_id`` from
the user's JWT — the ``tid`` claim is the only trusted source. There is
**no header-based tenant override** — Phase-1 had ``X-Tenant-ID`` and it
was removed because any user with a valid JWT could read any tenant's
rows just by spoofing the header.

The webhook ingest path (``POST /api/v1/events``) is the one exception:
it has no session cookie, so the per-tenant ``X-Daalu-Key`` ingest key
serves double duty as both auth and tenant resolution — the hash is
looked up against ``tenants.ingest_api_key_hash``.

DEFAULT_TENANT_ID remains the bootstrap tenant — see ``core/bootstrap.py``
— so a fresh install with one user keeps working without an explicit
``POST /tenants`` step.
