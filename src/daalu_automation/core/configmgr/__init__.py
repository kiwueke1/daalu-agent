"""Thin async clients for a per-tenant NVIDIA Config Manager (NV-CM) stack.

We deploy NV-CM unmodified (vendored pinned chart) and talk to its REST
API over the WireGuard tunnel via its ``svc-*`` (JWT-only) endpoints.
These clients are written against the committed OpenAPI specs at
``deploy/charts/nv-config-manager-<ver>-api-specs/`` and authenticate
with a Keycloak client-credentials JWT (see ``core/keycloak``).
