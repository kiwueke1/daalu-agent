"""Per-tenant Nautobot instance state.

One row per Daalu tenant that opted into the hosted-Nautobot tier.
Owns the lifecycle of an isolated Nautobot stack (web + worker +
scheduler + postgres + redis) — either in the operator's cluster
(``target_cluster_tunnel_id IS NULL``) or in the customer's own
cluster reached via WireGuard (``target_cluster_tunnel_id IS NOT
NULL``).

Replaces the pre-2026 shared-Nautobot model where every tenant got
an ObjectPermission slice of one shared instance.

The hostname + admin token written here are the same values the
tenant's ``Integration(provider="nautobot")`` row stores; the
Integration row is the customer-facing surface used by the
reconciler/executor/adapter code, and this row is the operator-side
materialisation state.
